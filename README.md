### Group-1 Of Software Engineering.

### Technical Tools or Softwear Used:

### Unity;
 Unity is the world's leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D (RT3D) content.Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D, and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C# using Mono, for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality.
 
 ### Visual Studio:
 The Visual Studio IDE is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build code, and then publish an app.
 
 ### Platforms:

## Source code for the app
--> Source code:
                  https://github.com/chay235/catBingoTeam

## Technical requirements: 
-> App front-end technology: Unity.

-> App back-end technology: Azure App Service.

-> Software engineering process: Agile process, DevOps methods

-> Software engineering team: Agile team

-> Software engineering tools: Azure DevOpsLinks (Boards, Pipeline, Repos, Test Plans, and Artifacts)

-> Cloud PaaS: Azure App Service

-> Business logic programming language: C# & C++#.

## Game Features: 
> Special Animal is used throughout our game to make the child learn with better understanding and with fun.

> There is a pet feeding feature which is an essential feature as the child sets to progress to feed the pet after every game.

> Our game is developed with a hint option where the child can guess the answer from the hints if he struggles for the answer.

> A classical music is added so the child can be calm and feel soothing while playing the game which helps him to learn more efficiently.

> Our game is developed with only one animal to attract the focus of the child more. For example, When the child selects the right answer a cat appears on the option button with a head movement.

> A report card is updated every time a child learns. Teacher and Parent can look at the report card for the progress of the child.

## Game Algorithm:

1. Install the game in your android or ios.

2. Select the Cat bingo option which then navigates to mathematic function screen.

3. Select the mathematic function which then navigates to the level screen where the child can select the difficulty level.

4. Select any one of the three difficulty level and play the game in the matrix screen where randomly generated questions make the game.

5. If the child selects the correct answer, a cat appears on the button with a certain movement.

6. The teacher and parents can check the child's progress in Report Card Screen.

7. The child can feel his/her pet whenever the pet is hungry. 

8. In this way the child can learn and have fun at the same time.
